Dead simple Python STOMP client library

    This is useful for connecting to and communicating with
    Apache ActiveMQ, an open source Java Message Service (JMS)
    message broker.

    The majority of the methods available take a single argument; a dictionary.
    This dictionary should contain the necessary bits you need
    to pass to the STOMP server.  It is outlined in each method
    exactly what it needs to work.

    For specifics on the protocol, see: http://stomp.codehaus.org/Protocol

    This library is basically a Python implementation of Perl's Net::Stomp
    See: http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-Stomp/lib/Net/Stomp.pm

    To enable the ActiveMQ Broker for Stomp add the following to the activemq.xml configuration:

    <connector>
        <serverTransport uri="stomp://localhost:61613"/>
    </connector>
